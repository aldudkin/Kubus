# ⎈ Kubedeck

**A free, open-source Kubernetes GUI** — a self-hosted alternative to [Aptakube](https://aptakube.com/), built with React, Material-UI and Node.js.

Connect to all your clusters at once, browse and edit every resource (CRDs included), stream aggregated logs, open shells into containers, forward ports, watch metrics, and inspect Helm releases — all from one polished web UI that runs entirely on your machine.

## Features

- **Multi-cluster, unified view** — connect to any number of kubeconfig contexts simultaneously; lists merge resources from all selected clusters with a cluster column.
- **Every resource kind** — builtin workloads, networking, config, storage, RBAC… plus all CRDs discovered dynamically.
- **Live updates** — informer-style watches over WebSocket keep every list in sync without refreshing (incl. resilient 410/reconnect handling).
- **Human-friendly details + YAML editor** — Monaco-powered YAML view/edit/create with conflict detection, plus per-kind overview tabs, events and metrics.
- **Quick actions** — delete, scale, rollout-restart, trigger CronJobs, cordon/uncordon and drain nodes (with live progress).
- **Aggregated log viewer** — stream logs from many pods at once, color-coded per pod, regex filter, follow, download, previous-container logs.
- **Container shell** — full xterm.js terminal over the Kubernetes exec API (bash with sh fallback, resize support).
- **Port forwarding** — one click from any Pod or Service (service ports resolve to targetPorts like kubectl), with a management panel.
- **Metrics & health overview** — CPU/memory from metrics-server with history charts, and a dashboard flagging failing pods, unavailable workloads, restarts and warning events.
- **Helm releases** — list, values (user + computed), manifests, history and uninstall — no helm binary required.
- **Resource diff** — side-by-side Monaco diff of any two resources across clusters/namespaces, with noise-field normalization.
- **Dark & light mode**, of course.

## Security model

Kubedeck is a *local* tool:

- The server binds to `127.0.0.1` only and talks directly to your cluster API servers using your existing kubeconfig — no data leaves your machine.
- Every request requires a random per-run bearer token (the browser receives it via the launch URL), protecting against DNS-rebinding/CSRF on localhost.
- Secret values are redacted by default everywhere (lists, details, watch streams); revealing them is an explicit per-resource action.

## Getting started

Requires **Node.js ≥ 22** and **pnpm**.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm start          # serves the UI and opens your browser
```

The server reads `~/.kube/config` (or `$KUBECONFIG`, or `--kubeconfig <path>`) and picks a port with `--port <n>` (default 3001).

### Development

```bash
pnpm dev            # tsx-watch server on :3001 + Vite client on :5173
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` — the Vite dev server proxies `/api` and `/ws` to the backend.

### Test clusters

`hack/dev-clusters.sh` spins up two [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) clusters with metrics-server, a sample Helm release, and intentionally broken workloads to exercise the overview dashboard.

## Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Browser — React 19 + MUI 7 SPA     │
│  TanStack Query · Monaco · xterm.js │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────┘
               │ REST + WebSocket (token-authed, same-origin)
┌──────────────┴──────────────────────┐
│  Node.js — Fastify 5                │
│  @kubernetes/client-node 1.x        │
│  watch multiplexing · log fan-in    │
│  exec bridge · port-forward manager │
│  helm secret decoding · metrics     │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────┘
               │ Kubernetes API (your kubeconfig credentials)
        ┌──────┴──────┐
        │  Clusters   │
        └─────────────┘
```

- `shared/` — TypeScript types + the WebSocket protocol (zod-validated) both sides compile against.
- `server/` — cluster manager (one isolated `KubeConfig` per context), generic resource routes driven by API discovery, informer-style watchers, helm release reader (base64 → gzip → JSON), metrics poller with ring buffers.
- `client/` — app shell (cluster switcher, nav drawer, namespace filter, bottom dock for terminals/logs), generic resource list page powered by per-kind column presets, detail drawer, overview/helm/diff/forwards pages.

## Known limitations

- Helm uninstall deletes manifest resources and release records but does **not** run Helm hooks.
- Port forwards live as long as the server process.
- WebSocket port-forward requires a reasonably recent API server (kubectl's SPDY fallback is not implemented).
